2018-02-06 - Version 1.6
    - Disable save/restore menu items for SHIVs. They were already
      excluded from squad loadouts with version 1.2, but could still
      use the individual save/restore loadout buttons. Restoring on
      a SHIV used the PFC banks and would corrupt the SHIV. Allowing
      SHIVS to have dedicated loadout banks may be implemented later.

2016-02-03 - Version 1.5
    - Add localization support & Russian translations.

2016-01-09 - Version 1.4
    - Fix bug with restoring psi-limited items onto non-psi soldiers.
      These items and armors will now not be added to non-psi troops.
    - Fix bug with rocketeers being assigned rocket launchers as their
      primary weapon after failing to restore another weapon due to
      a lack of inventory.

2015-12-30 - Version 1.3
    - Fix bug with psi soldiers powers like Mindfray doing no damage.
    - Fix bug with "MISSING ITEM" items appearing in the grey market.

2015-12-27 - Version 1.2
    - Fix bug when applying squad loadouts with SHIVs in the squad.

2015-12-26 - Version 1.1
    - Reduced the font size in the loadout descriptions displayed in
      the soldier summary UI. This should prevent overflow of long
      loadouts beyond the background panel.
    - Adjusted the positioning of the description text to avoid the
      menu buttons from overflowing into it for soldiers that have
      more than 7 options (e.g. those that have both psi abilities and
      gene mods, or are officers and have gene mods).
    - Added controller support for the Squad Loadout buttons, mapped
      to left and right triggers, respectively.

2015-12-23 - Version 1.0
