2015-12-27 - Version 1.2
    - Fix bug when applying squad loadouts with SHIVs in the squad.

2015-12-26 - Version 1.1
    - Reduced the font size in the loadout descriptions displayed in
      the soldier summary UI. This should prevent overflow of long
      loadouts beyond the background panel.
    - Adjusted the positioning of the description text to avoid the
      menu buttons from overflowing into it for soldiers that have
      more than 7 options (e.g. those that have both psi abilities and
      gene mods, or are officers and have gene mods).
    - Added controller support for the Squad Loadout buttons, mapped
      to left and right triggers, respectively.
